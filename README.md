#TACYT MALTEGO TRANSFORMS

## INSTALL

1) Import the MTZ file from “Manage, Import, Config” menu.
2) Once imported, check the Python path and transforms paths themselves match the ones in your system. Click on “Manage Transforms” and search for *tct* (with wildcards) to show all Tacyt transforms. Select them all using shift button.
3) In “Transform Inputs”, modify “Command line”, and “Working directory” (where the .py transforms are) accordingly.
